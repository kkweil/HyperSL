## 📎 Overview

HyperSL is designed to:

* Learn transferable spectral representations across heterogeneous hyperspectral sensors
* Accept arbitrary spectral input dimensions (bands, range)
* Generalize without retraining and modifying network structure

## 🛠️ Features

* Masked self-supervised learning strategy tailored for spectral data
* Unified spectral token representation
* Wavelength-aware positional encoding
* Trained on over 300 million spectra from multiple sensors
